# Lib Orange Power
Generic C++20 library.

`jsoncpp` is used for JSON support:  https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp
SDL2 is the version of SDL supported by `src/sdl`

Any utility code I write that I use in more than one project is likely to
end up in this library.

What I use the most from this library is #included in
  `examples/example_misc_includes/misc_includes.hpp`
mainly for my own convenience so I don't have to re-type its contents.
